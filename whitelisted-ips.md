# IBM Cloud CIS whitelisted IP addresses
{:#cis-whitelisted-ip-addresses}

The following API lists all IP addresses used by CIS Edges when communicating with origins: [https://api.cis.cloud.ibm.com/v1/ips](https://api.cis.cloud.ibm.com/v1/ips). Polling this API once a week is sufficient to get the information you need to update your whitelists.
