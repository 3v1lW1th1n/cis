# Firewall Rules
{: #firewall-rules}

{{site.data.keyword.cis_full}} Firewall Rules offer power and flexibility by targeting HTTP traffic and applying custom criteria to block, challenge, log, or allow certain requests.

## Plan Entitlements

You can create many types of Firewall Rules. However, the number of active rules on your site is limited by your customer plan. See the [Plan comparison](/docs/infrastructure/cis?topic=cis-cis-plan-comparison) page for more information on entitlements.

The number of active rules per plan is fixed. You cannot purchase additional active rules at this time.
