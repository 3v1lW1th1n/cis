# Firewall rules
{: #firewall-rules}

{{site.data.keyword.cis_full}} firewall rules offer power and flexibility by targeting HTTP traffic and applying custom criteria to block, challenge, log, or allow certain requests.
{: shortdesc}

## Plan entitlements

You can create many types of firewall rules. However, the number of active rules on your site is limited by your customer plan. See the [Plan comparison](/docs/cis?topic=cis-cis-plan-comparison) page for more information on entitlements.

The number of active rules per plan is fixed. You cannot purchase additional active rules at this time.
