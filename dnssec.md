# DNS Security
{:#dns-security}

DNS is the protocol that translates domain names such as `ibm.com` to IP addresses. Unfortunately, it has one major security flaw: the end user has no guarantee that no one tampered with the records received. For example, forged DNS records can redirect browsers to fetch content from a malicious website, add JavaScript to run on a page, or even route email to an attackerâ€™s mail server.

## DNSSEC, an introduction
{:#dnssec-introduction}

DNSSEC is the protocol that ensures the authenticity of DNS records. It uses public-key cryptography to let the DNS server sign records with a private key, and allow the DNS resolvers to verify the signatures with a public key

To turn on DNS Security (DNSSEC), add a DS record to your registrar. See [How do I add a DS Record to my registrar?](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006660072){:external}, written by our partners at Cloudflare, for a detailed guide by registrar.
