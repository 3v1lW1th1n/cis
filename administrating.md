# Administrative best practices
{:#administrative-best-practices}

{{site.data.keyword.cis_full}} provides many ways you can administer your brand presence, your account security, and your support process. We recommend working through each of the administrative best practices listed in this document, to ensure that your customers and your content are best served by your {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}} network.

## Manage your brand by customizing {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}} pages
{:#manage-your-brand-by-customizing-cis-pages}

{{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}} must show content to your end-users occasionally. This content can include security challenge pages, block pages, and error pages. You can customize any of this content to create a consistent branding experience for your customers.

Here are two ways to customize your {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}} pages:

1. **Domain-Wide:** Within the settings of each domain, you can go to the **Customize** application to change the default pages for any page we could potentially show your users.

2. **Organization-Wide:** If you have many domains within your {{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}} account and you'd like to create Custom pages for all of them, you can do so within your **Organization** settings.

## Enforce multifactor authentication across your entire organization
{:#enforce-multifactor-authentication}
Follow the procedures described in [Requiring MFA for users in your account](/docs/iam?topic=iam-enablemfa#enablemfa) to enable multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users.
