# Scheduled Maintenance
{:#cis-scheduled-maintenance}

IBM Cloud Internet Services occasionally undergoes planned maintenance. During these windows, some elements may not be available. 

On **April 5, 2019, starting at 2:00 UTC**, an update to Cloud Internet Services backend subscription systems will occur. This maintenance is estimated to take 30 minutes to complete. 

Cloudflare will be performing maintenance on the subscription systems to provide better resiliency. 

During this period, you will not be able to create new instances, delete existing instances, or upgrade/downgrade existing Cloud Internet Services Plans. You will also not be able to add new domains or delete existing domains during this time.  Additionally, you will not be able to make load balancer configuration changes (health checks will still continue).

Updates to existing configurations and the data path will not be impacted during this maintenance.
